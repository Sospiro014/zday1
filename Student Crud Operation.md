### Vulnerability Description:

This code snippet is susceptible to SQL injection attacks as it lacks proper input validation and sanitation. User inputs, such as user_first_name and user_last_name, are directly incorporated into SQL queries, enabling malicious users to manipulate data and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.



### Proof of Concept (PoC):

An example scenario for a SQL injection attack could involve manipulating data in fields like user_first_name or user_last_name using the following payload:
```
' OR '1'='1'; --
```
In this case, the SQL query would look like:

```
SELECT * FROM card_activation WHERE u_f_name = '' OR '1'='1'; -- AND ...
```

This would retrieve all records, providing access to data controlled by the attacker.



### Vulnerable code section:

```
$u_f_name = $_POST['user_first_name'];
$u_l_name = $_POST['user_last_name'];

// ...

$insert_data = "INSERT INTO card_activation(u_card, u_f_name, u_l_name, ... VALUES ('$u_card','$u_f_name','$u_l_name', ...)";
```

Here, variables like $u_f_name and $u_l_name are directly included in the SQL query without proper validation or sanitation.
